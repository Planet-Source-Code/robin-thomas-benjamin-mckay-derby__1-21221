**** THE DERBY 1.03 ***** - WRITTEN BY ROBIN MCKAY


Welcome to the derby. Bet until your heart is content with one of the
slickest games. It may not be 3D, but hey, it is still pretty 
addictive. You can even bet on which horse you think will win and get
yourself a well deserved pay packet. 

I have included a link so that you can get the Hanz character and the
Lernout and Hauspie speech engine. Install MS Agent from Microsoft by
going to this webring.


************WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 1.03?************

Now added MS Agent Support for all those of you whom want to see a
jolly commentary during the race -- It's rather fun! 

Corrected a few minor details and added the character Hanz to
support MS Agent Functionality.

Version 1.03 now requires that you have MS Agent installed on the
system. If you don't, you can find it at many places. One is the
MS Agent web ring. All information about MS Agent can be found
there. 

Fixed a bug where horses are not properly remembered as well. I am
sorry about that! Must have been frustrating.

********The Derby Version 2.0********

As of yet I have no plans to make Derby 2.0. I will do, but not in
the forseeable future. That's because I have a truckload of work to
complete for college. However, at the end of the semester for this
year, around June, expect a brand new Derby Version 2.0.0 on the
PSC website. 

What to expect in Derby 2.0:


* MS Agent Supported Program -- 1.03 supports Agent, but in this 
  version, I will add stronger Agent Support and more features. 

* I will also add some brand new menu features. 

* I will also correct any bugs found in this version and future
  versions. 

* All Minor Updates will have bugs fixed so don't worry about
  having to wait for version 2.0 of the program 

***********************************************************************

The Derby 2.0 release details
*****************************

The Derby 2.0 shall be released in the Summer, hopefully. June is just
a provisional month, so it may be earlier or later or in June. More
details in forthcoming versions of the Minor Derby Updates. Watch this
space, everyone. The Derby is always being updated, so check back for
bigger versions and superior versions all the time. Of course, I need
your feedback so that I can incorporate what you want into this 
program. Thanks for supporting Derby 1.0 and expect to see the new
version quite soon.

Derby better, do let me know. And many thanks to everyone for all their
support. 

I have added a few more features in this new Zip version! Fixed a very
annoying bug (I hope) with the winnings as well. I've also added the
ability to rename your horses.

Fixed another bug with labels displayed at run-time. Sorry.

Happy coding, everyone and have a splendid 2001!
